3. **Summary**<br/>I am a beginner frontend developer. I graduated from college as a technical programmer. After that, I briefly worked in a specialty and then I served in the army. Later I worked in non-programming jobs. However, I got very interested in front-end development. First I took the course "Website layout from 0 to 1", then took a course on Udemy "Modern JavaScript - from Zero to Junior Specialist + React Fundamentals".
